farmstand app

-One day I was having a conversation with my dad (who owns a farm in Nigeria)and he was telling me about bringing 
produce to the market. the issue he brought to my attention was he was unware if all the produce was in demand and if 
he should bring all his product to market. From that conversation came FarmStnd

FarmSTND will allow farmers to look and see what produce is in demand, allow consumers to see what is coming to market- 
vote on what they would like to see make it to market allowing the farmer to dictate how much of each they bring, and 
most importantly
